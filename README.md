Preliminary Setup Steps
-----------------------
To run this example you'll need to install the following packages
inside your virtual machine:
```sh
sudo apt-get install python pandas
```

```
sudo pip install --upgrade pandas
```

```sh
    sudo apt-get install libgeos-3.3.3 python-mpltoolkits.basemap python-mpltoolkits.basemap-data python-mpltoolkits.basemap-doc
```
Then run the notebook from your machine with this command:

    ipython notebook --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0 --script --pylab=inline




1) Data Curation
We decided to continue using the csv file because we wanted to have some form
of reproducible output and our group tried to learn JSON but did not feel it 
would be as productive as continuing to use the csv file. 

2) Visualization
